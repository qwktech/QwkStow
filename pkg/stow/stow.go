// Package stow is the backend Go module for GoStow, a program for managing
// the installation of software packages, keeping them separate
// (C</usr/local/stow/emacs> vs. C</usr/local/stow/perl>, for example)
// while making them appear to be installed in the same place
// (C</usr/local>).
//
// GoStow doesn't store an extra state between runs, so there's no danger
// of mangling directories when file hierarchies don't match the
// database. Also, stow will never delete any files, directories, or
// links that appear in a stow directory, so it is always possible to
// rebuild the target tree.
//
// This is intended to be a 1:1 implementation of the original Stow source code
// found in the git repo https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/stow.git.
//
